# Beats Music Player

Plays tracks from Beats Music, letting you select from Beats featured albums/playlists and Editor Picks.

To run on your own server, first acquire a Beats client ID and secret [here](https://developer.beatsmusic.com). Save them in environment variables BEATS_KEY and BEATS_SECRET.

Then, `git clone` this repository, `cd` into the directory, and run `npm install`. To start the local server, run `npm start`.

TODO:
- Tests
- Scrubber for current position in playing track
- Highlight currently playing playlist
- Mouseover animation for featured playlists (maybe)
